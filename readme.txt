A plugin to display a list of all the shortcodes available for use on the post and page edit screens.

== Description ==
Shortcode Lister is a plugin designed to display a list of all the shortcodes available to use in your posts and pages. 

If you have downloaded several plugins that produce their own custom shortcodes, it may become cumbersome to remember all of the shortcodes you have available to use. In a way this defeats the purpose of having an easy to use shortcode, if it is too difficult to remember them all.

This plugin solves that problem, by producing a clean, easily accessible list of all the custom/third party added, and WordPress default shortcodes that you are able to use inside your posts and pages.

== Installation ==
1. Download archive and unzip in wp-content/plugins or install via Plugins - Add New.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.
3. View your list of available shortcodes in the Page or Post editor screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this plugin list default shortcodes that come with WordPress? =
Yes. According to the WordPress Codex, the following are built-in shortcodes that will be shown in the Shortcode Lister:
* [audio]
* [caption]
* [embed]
* [gallery]
* [video]

= What about shortcodes from other plugins? =
Most shortcodes created by plugins you have downloaded will be included in Shortcode Lister found on your Post or Page edit screen. If you have a plugin that produces shortcodes and it is not listed in the Shortcode Lister menu, please let me know: http://oizuled.com/contact/shortcode-lister-reporting-form/

= Why would I need this plugin? =
If you like wasting time by under using shortcodes that have been provided to you by the great plugins you have downloaded, then you probably do not need this plugin.

If you are like thousands of other people who want to use WordPress to its full potential, shortcodes are a great way to save time. This plugin will save you even more time if your list of shortcodes gets too big for you to remember all of them by producing a list of shortcodes where you use them most - the Post and Page edit screens.

= I have a block of text that I use over and over in my site. Can I create my own shortcode to use instead of typing it all the time? =
Absolutely! I have even written a quick tutorial on how to do just that: http://oizuled.com/custom-wordpress-shortcodes/

= Can I remove the donate link that gets added to the menu? Do I have to pay to use this plugin? =
You can remove the donate link by changing the line $show_donation = "true"; to $show_donation = "false"; in shortcode-lister.php. This plugin is free to use, and a donation is not required, but does help to encourage future development of this and other plugins.
